# How to: Import HTML Files that Contain Images Referenced with a Custom Prefix

This example illustrates how to obtain an image referenced with the _'cid'_ prefix from an external file in BMP format.

The Rich Text Editor allows you to import HTML files that contain embedded images or links to external images with the **src** attribute specified as an image URL. However, you can have web files where images are referenced in a custom manner (for example, with the prefix 'cid' in the **img src** attribute, as in email files). In this case, you need to implement and register a custom [IUriStreamProvider](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/DevExpress.Office.Services.IUriStreamProvider) to import these files into the Rich Text Editor.
